# FlappyGame
Welcome to the Flappy game. Enter your name and press "Start Flappy" to start.

Tap on the screen to keep the bird afloat and guide it through the maze of pipes.
The longer you can go, the higher you score.
The game ends when the bird touches one of the pipes or it falls into the ground below, and dies.

You can press the restart icon on the menu bar after the bird dies to start another game under the same username.
Press the home icon to start a new game under a different username.

Your scores are recorded. Press the leaderboard icon in the home screen or in the menu bar of the game screen to view the leaderboard. 
You can also choose to clear the leaderboard from the home page.

Enjoy!
